# 🛒 E-Commerce Sales EDA & Analysis (Python)

I developed an **E-Commerce Sales Dashboard & Analysis Project** using **Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Plotly**.  
The project explores **sales, profit, discounts, customer behavior, and shipping performance** across categories, states, and regions to deliver **actionable business insights**.

## 📊 KPI Overview
- **Total Orders:** 9,997  
- **Total Sales:** $2.3M  
- **Total Profit:** $286K  
- **Profit Margin:** 12.47%  
- **Total Quantity Sold:** 38K  
- **Average Order Value (AOV):** $230  

**Year-over-Year Comparison (2013 → 2014)**  
- 📈 Orders: 2,580 → 3,319 (**+28.6%**)  
- 💰 Sales: $608K → $734K (**+20.5%**)  
- 💹 Profit: $82K → $94K (**+14.9%**)  
- 📊 Profit Margin: 13.4% → 12.8%  
- 📦 Quantity: 9,810 → 12,497 (**+27.4%**)  
- 🧾 AOV: $236 → $221 (**–6.3%**)  

👉 **Insight:** Strong YOY growth in orders, sales, and profit. Slight dip in AOV and margin highlights need for discount control & product mix optimization.

---

## 📅 Monthly Performance
- **Best Months:** December, November, October, September, March → peak sales & profit  
- **Weak Months:** February (lowest), January  
- **Summer (Apr–Aug):** mid-range ($160K–$177K)  

👉 **Insight:** Winter season drives maximum sales → promotional campaigns needed in summer.

---

## 🛒 Category & Sub-Category Analysis
- **Top Categories:** Technology & Office Supplies (strong profit drivers)  
- **Furniture:** High sales, but weak profits  
- **Top Sub-Categories:** Phones, Chairs, Storage, Tables, Binders  
- **Loss-Making Sub-Categories:** Tables, Bookcases, Supplies → total loss **–$22K**  

👉 **Insight:** Furniture (esp. Tables & Bookcases) pulls profitability down.

---

## 💸 Discount Impact
- Discounts up to **10–20%** = boost in sales & profits ✅  
- Discounts **>20%** = losses ❌  

👉 **Action:** Limit heavy discounts; use targeted offers & collect customer feedback.

---

## 🌍 Regional & State Analysis
- **Best Region:** West (leader), followed by East  
- **Weak Region:** South → needs strategy  
- **Top States:** California & New York (growth engines)  

---

## 🚚 Shipping Performance
- **Standard Class:** 60% (most preferred)  
- **Second Class & First Class:** 19% & 15%  
- **Same Day:** only 5%  
- **Avg Delivery Time:** 3–5 days  

👉 **Insight:** Customers prefer affordable + fast delivery. Orders drop if >5 days.
